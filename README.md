These customers consistently demonstrate **above-average purchasing behavior** and represent the **most strategic opportunity for marketing efforts**.

## Targeting Considerations

- Customers who did not Indicate their job industries i.e `n/a` or `"unsure"` gender values should be validated before exclusion.
- Tailor campaigns by **wealth tier** (e.g., ***premium offers for High Net Worth vs general promotions for Mass Customers***).
- Continue using segmentation insights to guide future acquisition and engagement strategies.

## Next Steps

- Present findings to the marketing team.
- Use dashboard filters to dynamically explore and segment target audiences.
- Incorporate these insights into the next marketing plan.
